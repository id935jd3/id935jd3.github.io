        <p>
            Welcome to Gentrification Map The Hague. This online research project strives to map out gentrification as
            it happens in the city of The Hague, as well as other housing struggle related issues. If you have
            information that you see missing from the map or that could in another way contribute to this research,
            please send us an email at woonopstanddenhaag(at)riseup.net.
        </p>

        <h1>Why this map</h1>
        <p>
            Gentrification is a hard to pinpoint process that often silently slips into neighbourhoods and is often
            noticed by the people most effected when it's already too late to effectively organise against it. So in an
            attempt to overcome it's invisibility, we wanted to reveal it's process on a base of location and time. By
            mapping it out and therefore better understanding the process we hope to stop the city from being sold and
            re-establish it for the people that live here trough community organising.
        </p>

        <h1>What is gentrification</h1>
        <p>
            Gentrification is a complicated term for a process by which a neighbourhood gets redeveloped or "improved".
            However, instead of being in the benefit of its current residents, gentrification pushes out low-income
            residents through exorbitant price increases.
        </p>

        <h2>How does it start</h2>
        <p>
            Gentrification usually starts with changes that attract new, wealthier people and more exclusive businesses:
            the cheap corner shop is being replaced by a fancy supermarket; the local cafe by an expensive lunchroom;
            the old factory with temporary art studios by hand craft boutiques, vintage pop-up stores and a designer
            studio.
        </p>

        <h2>The intermediate outcome</h2>
        <p>
            The neighbourhood is being upgraded, in terms of diversity, liveness from the creative field,
            entrepreneurship and material conditions. This in itself is not a problem, however it brings about a steady
            increase in the rents, regardless of the stagnant income of the original residents.
        </p>

        <h2>The unjust result</h2>
        <p>
            The steady increase in the quality of the neighbourhood is used by the investors to eventually kick out not
            only the less wealthy residents, but also the new businesses and initiatives. Eventually, making the
            neighbourhood only affordable to the rich.
        </p>

        <h1>How does the map work</h1>

        <p>
            As you can see the map of The Hague is divided in neighbourhoods. Each neighbourhood is highlighted by a
            different colour, which indicates it's process of gentrification, as shown by the legend. Within each
            neighbourhood is the possibility of clicking to receive standard info about the infrastructure, additional
            information about specific examples of sell-outs of social housing, housing groups going on rent strike or
            year long empty buildings that were squatted. Along with that you will be provided with some links in
            relation to the specific gentrification processes of that neighbourhood.
